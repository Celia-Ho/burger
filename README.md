# Eat-Da-Burger!

The Eat-Da-Burger! application is a burger logger created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a ORM. The MVC design pattern is followed; Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app.  Handlebars are used to generate the HTML.

## Description

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
